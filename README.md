# Interactive Code Execution

This project contains code relating to my ISA (Individual Student Activity) *"Interactive Code Execution in ScalableTeaching"*. 

The project runs from February 1st to June 30th.

Student: **Alexander NÃ¸rup**, alnoe20@student.sdu.dk

Supervisors:
- **Aisha Umair**: aiu@mmmi.sdu.dk
- **Miguel Enrique Campusano Araya**: mica@mmmi.sdu.dk

## Running the code

As of writing, this is just a PoC. Have the Docker-engine running on your computer, and use of the launch-profiles available in `Properties/launchSettings.json`.

Good luck :)

## Demo video
